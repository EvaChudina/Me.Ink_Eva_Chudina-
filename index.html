                            the assignment was 2 make a catalogue containing things tht meet
                            the criteria & definitions outlined in the whole earth-chan catalog. My tools catalogue is based on the same theme: sustainable living or ‘‘zero waste’’ lifestyle. 0 waste is a philosophy tht encourages the redesign of resource lyfe cycles so tht all products r reused. My min goal was 2 find tools which wud b eco friendly and can b reusable(so less waste
                            wud b produced). Such regular things tht ppl can replace in our everyday lifestyles. My tools r 10 items separ8d into 2 themes: items tht have a use fo' something(reusable bottle and cup, bags, wax napkin) and items fo' personal hygienes(soap, shampoo, deodorant, toothbrush and tooth-powder, cotton pads.)
                            i was looking fo' specific items depending on sources of russian 0 waste community and items tht u can get @ moscow 2.  I selected it depending on ratings and reviews of ppl on different eco theme-rel8d online shops.  I added reviews of ppl on a few items tht wer needed 2 use directly 2 urself nor fo' something(bottle fo' drinking, shampoo fo' washing ur hair and e. g).
